## Interesting Analysis Ideas
The dataset can be used for different analysis, example -

1. Perform Clustering / Segmentation on the dataset and identify popular customer groups along with their definitions/rules
2. Perform Location-wise analysis to identify regional trends in India
3. Perform transaction-related analysis to identify interesting trends that can be used by a bank to improve / optimize their user experiences
4. Customer Recency, Frequency, Monetary analysis
5. Network analysis or Graph analysis of customer data.

### notebooks:
1. Data cleaning and EDA
    handle missing values
    handle outliers
    feature engineering - location and date types
    handle categorical variables
    EDA 

    1. Data Cleaning and Exploration: Clean and explore the data to check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Identify the range of values for each column and check for any anomalies.

    5. User Demographics Analysis: Analyze the user demographics such as age and gender to identify the target audience for the bank's services. This information can be used by the bank to create targeted campaigns and improve user experiences.

2. Normal Clustering
    try out different clustering algorithms
    hyper parameter tuning
    cluster analysis

3. Location-wise analysis
    perform location-wise analysis
    identify regional trends in India

    To perform transaction-related analysis and identify interesting trends that can be used by a bank to improve/optimize their user experiences, you could follow these steps:

    4. User Location Analysis: Analyze the user location to identify the areas with the highest number of transactions. This information can be used by the bank to optimize their services and offer targeted promotional campaigns.

    7. Fraud Detection Analysis: Analyze the data for any unusual transaction patterns or frauds. This information can help the bank in detecting and preventing frauds.

    By performing the above analyses, you can identify interesting trends that can be used by the bank to improve/optimize their user experiences.

4. Transaction analysis
    perform transaction analysis
    identify interesting trends that can be used by a bank to improve / optimize their user experiences.

    1. Transaction Frequency Analysis: Analyze the transaction frequency to identify the peak transaction hours, peak transaction days, and average transaction frequency. This information can be used by the bank to optimize their services based on user behavior.

    2. Transaction Amount Analysis: Analyze the transaction amount to identify the average transaction amount, maximum and minimum transaction amount, and the distribution of transaction amounts. This information can help the bank in optimizing their services and fees.

    3. Account Balance Analysis: Analyze the account balance to identify the average account balance, the number of users with a low account balance, and the average transaction amount for users with low account balances. This information can help the bank in designing services that cater to users with low account balances.

    4. Transaction Categorization Analysis: Analyze the transaction categories to identify the most frequent transaction types. This information can be used by the bank to create targeted campaigns and improve user experiences.

5. Customer RFM analysis
    perform customer RFM analysis
    identify popular customer groups along with their definitions/rules

6. Network analysis
